# Rock Paper Scissors

5/26

<br>

My first website game of rock paper scissors vs a bot. When loaded, images for each choice will slide up allowing the user to pick between rock, paper, or scissors to defeat the bot. If the user wins, the background will turn green and their score will increase, and if the user loses, the backgrond will turn red and the bot's score will increase. And if no one wins the background becomes darker and will show 'Draw'.

## Features

<br>

- I added alot of hovering effects onto the title, the 'vs', github repo link, and the choices since I liked CSS and the way they animated.
- There is an array storing a few different emojis for winning and losing and it picks a random emoji depending if the user won or lost and it will be displayed.
