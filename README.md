## Rock Paper Scissors

My first website game of rock paper scissors vs a bot. When loaded, images for each choice will slide up allowing the user to pick to defeat the bot, if the user wins the background will go green and their score will increase, and if the user loses the backgrond will change red and the bot's score will increase. If no one wins then the background turns darker and displays 'Draw'.

# Features

I added alot of hovering effects onto the title, the 'vs', github repo link, and the choices since I liked CSS and the way they animated.
